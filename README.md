## About

React native app styled with react-native-elements. Made for my friends and I to keep up with the NBA. Feel free to use and take anything for your own sports app.:thumbsup::thumbsup:

Only previewed/used in Expo currently, so no idea on how the NBA api handles in production. Paths sometimes change due to official changes/bugs.
