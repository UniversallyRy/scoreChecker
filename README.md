## About

React Native app created with Expo, animated using Moti and styled with native-base. Made for my friends, and I, to keep up with the NBA. Feel free to use and take anything for your own sports app.:thumbsup::thumbsup:

Only developed in Expo/Android so no idea on how the NBA api handles in production. Paths sometimes changes due to request to NBA's official api.

Bugs- No Preseason support(Team scores, game stats, playerstats).

## Demo
